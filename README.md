# Web Scraping for Bill Data from Texas Gas Service Website

This project utilizes Playwright for browser automation, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, and Pandas for data manipulation to scrape bill data from the Texas Gas Service website.

## Overview

The script automates the process of logging into the Texas Gas Service account portal, extracts bill data, cleans and processes it, and saves it as CSV files locally. It also provides a function to retrieve previously scraped bill data using the account number.

## Features

- **Login Automation**: Automates login process using provided username and password.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts bill data including bill amount and date from the account page.
- **Data Cleaning**: Uses BeautifulSoup to parse and clean HTML data.
- **Data Storage**: Saves cleaned bill data as CSV files named after the account number.
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieves previously saved bill data based on the account number.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Playwright
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- Pandas

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/texas-gas-service-scraper.git
cd texas-gas-service-scraper
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Scraper**: Execute the `Scraper()` function with your Texas Gas Service account credentials to initiate the scraping process.

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

   Enter your username and password when prompted.

2. **Retrieve Bill Data**: Use the `finder()` function with the account number to retrieve previously scraped bill data.

   ```python
   from scraper import finder

   acc_no = "123456789"  # Replace with your actual account number
   bill_data = finder(acc_no)
   print(bill_data)
   ```

## Example

Here's an example of using the scraper and data retrieval functions:

```python
from scraper import Scraper, finder

# Run scraper to fetch new data
uname = input("Enter Username:")
passwd = input("Enter Password:")
acc_no = Scraper(uname, passwd)

# Retrieve saved data
bill_data = finder(acc_no)
print("Bill Data:")
print(bill_data)
```
